# Problem Statement:
Photographers use drive as the final selection tool from clients/customers. 

Cons:
- Every file needs to be opened and deleted if not needed
- Photos cannot be viewed without clicking on each and every item
- Giving file names to the photographer is not easy to manage, as we cannot see the final selected photos without searching each and every names
- Adding *Starred* is individual to the users, it won't appear to others 
- no single place to see the notes/comments on the photos in the album
